Write a basic Rectangle
It turns out that you've written the best Rectangle class anyone has ever seen and so it's decided to be used across the company.
1000's of usages.... then you need to make an optimization....
Instead of storing length and width, it turns out that storing the diagnol of rectangle will be more efficient.... save 32 bits.
Since you're Rectangle class is used in millions of places, this optimization is absolutely essential!
If you don't have encapsulation, you're screwed.

Java Programmers were freaking out about pointers! :-)
No Classes.... Just structs!
