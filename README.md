Examples of Object Oriented Design in Java for the LaunchCode Community

The most widely asked interview question for developers all time is:
"What are the principles of object oriented design?"

Good thing you have a nice acronym.
P   olymorphism
I   nheritance
E   ncapsulation

These principles differentiate object oriented programming from procedural programming
and provide the essential language constructs to keep you code DRY

Polymorphism is the scariest word out of the bunch.  It simply means that your object can appear as
multiple types.  This makes your code extensible.  Instead of having to ask for one specific type, you
can ask for a type which could be many different things.
