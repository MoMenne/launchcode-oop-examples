Examples of Object Oriented Design in Java for the LaunchCode Community

The most widely asked interview question for developers all time is:
"What are the principles of object oriented design?"

Good thing you have a nice acronym.
P   olymorphism
I   nheritance
E   ncapsulation

These principles differentiate object oriented programming from procedural programming
and provide the essential language constructs to keep you code DRY
